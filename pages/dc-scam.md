# Stop falling for Discord QR code scams
Someone allegedly posted your private photos, there's a game for free or you want me to check #general? **More and more Discord users get such messages with an invitation link.** If you then enter the server, you are supposed to scan a QR code for verification, and once you have done that, the unexpected happens. Suddenly, such an invitation link is sent to all your Discord contacts and if you have deposited payment information even Nitro is bought and possibly the server is boosted.

## What's going on right now?
Users are being asked to scan QR codes via the Discord app, which results in someone else gaining access to their account.

## Something like this happened to me, what do I do now?
- Change your password and enable 2-factor authentication.
- Check if any payments have been made and contact your bank
- If you are still on the server, you can report the bot sending such QR codes [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

# What should I know now to prevent falling for those scams?
**The most important thing is not to scan QR codes through the Discord app, for any reason except if you want to log in on the PC via QR code, because the QR code function is officially only for that purpose and you can't use it to activate Nitro or do any verification.**

Take care of yourselves.
